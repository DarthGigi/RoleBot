        "When we refer to a `category` we're describing how RoleBot groups together a bunch of react roles, **not** a Discord category. Categories can be configured to change up how users obtain roles. More on this later!\n",
        "When we refer to a `react role` we're describing the relationship you make between an **emoji** and a **Discord role**. RoleBot uses this information to know what role to give a user when they react to a setup message.\n",
        "**React roles** MUST be within a **category** in order for users to obtain any roles. RoleBot uses categories as a way to remember react roles and settings for each one."

        "When creating a react role with RoleBot there's two things you need to keep in mind.\n",
        "**You cannot have duplicate roles OR emojis**. This is vital since RoleBot uses the emoji reacted with to figure out which role a user should get.",
        "Creating a react role is easy! Simply do `/react-role` then pass in the role and emoji you want paired together.\n",
        "It's recommended that you create a few react roles before adding them to a category to save time.\n",
        "**Warning:** Sometimes you may want to delete a role in your server, most times RoleBot will catch that and remove react roles that had that. If RoleBot misses that and you see `@deleted` in the react role list use the `/react-clean` command.\n",
        "_(If you do decide to add a lot of react roles at the start, you'll be limited to 25 react roles until you start adding them to categories. This is a Discord limitation.)_"

        "* `category-desc` is the category description. This is text that will show above the react roles in the embed when displayed. Use it to briefly describe the purpose of the category or theme.",
