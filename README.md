## This needs to be updated some time, that time is not now.

## TLDR;
I made this bot forever ago in ~2017 where I made some super goofy solution for a single server where there was this horrible "primary" "secondary" role system. Worked great for some but god it was confusing.

After awhile people really wanted reaction roles, that was implemented.. poorly.

Now in 2022 around April Discord is enforcing most bots to use their new crappy slash command system so now I find myself updating this bot to try and keep it alive as it's in >1500 servers.

> However, I lost access to my original account to which the original RoleBot belongs to, yet I have the token to keep it alive and hosted.

So now I do this rewrite in hopes to replace the existing RoleBot with much much better code.
